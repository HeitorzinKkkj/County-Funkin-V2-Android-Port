# Friday Night Funkin': Forever (ALPHA)

![logo](/art/forever/foreverLogo-small.png)

---

Forever is a complete recreation of [Friday Night Funkin'](https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin) which aims to bring a more enhanced experience over the base game, providing features and enhancements seen in other rhythm games, along with modding support.

Currently, Forever is in a HUGE development phase, but may already contain the features its meant to, feedback will always be appreciated and we hope to bring a neat modding tool for the community.

Forever is, and will always be, a Community-Driven Project as a love letter to it.

**Forever is not associated with its previous owner**

**This is a complete revamp made as a love letter to the community**

**Not as a means to bring said previous owner back into it.**

# NOTICE:

You need the LATEST version of haxe to be able to compile Forever, previous versions lack a lot of useful syntax stuff that forever makes use of, [Download Latest Haxe](https://haxe.org/download/), then run `setup.bat` (or `setup.sh` if you are on Linux or Mac)
