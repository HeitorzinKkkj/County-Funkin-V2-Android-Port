# Here's custom intro text sections!!
#
# a Section Line may be constructed like this
#
# - {step: stephere (optional) beat: beatHere, text: "yourTextHere", exec: "yourMethodHere", force: false | true}
#
# Sections have special methods that can be used
# in the `exec` field, you get the following methods
#
# "create" -> Creates a new text collection and breaks lines when you put a comma (,)
# "add" -> Adds to an existing text collection
# "delete" -> Deletes the current displayed text collection
#
# Additionally, you may include `force` whenever you need to force and operation to happen
# this `force` field may be used with the `create` or `add` methods
#
